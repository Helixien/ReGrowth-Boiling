	<description>ReGrowth is a mod deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Vanilla Expanded Series and the understanding how biomes work, what role they play in your game. Everything added was made to fit or mirror vanilla. From a simple UI texture to a new more complex system,being as performance and vanilla friendly is the main objective we have.

Inspired by the Disney show “The Owl House”, the Boiling Forests is a new biome filled with colourful trees, plants and hotsprings. Created by a long gone megacorp for an immersive theme park, it is unknown how this biome made its way to a Rimworld. It is by far the most unique biome I have made so far and I am honestly stunned by it myself.

Boiling Forests are a simple biome, there is no performance hungry code you can't turn off or new features you will only find there. Its goal is to add variety for the player and to bring things from “The Owl House” into Rimworld in a lore friendly way!

ReGrowth is designed to be as lightweight as possible, adding the minimum of new code required for its auditions to work.</description>
